# NAudio Sine Generator with Portamento Sample

This sample applications shows how you can generate a sine wave with portamento in NAudio. For performance it uses a wavetable to store the sine wave, allowing this technique to be easily tried with other waveforms.

The `SineWaveProvider` class implements the tone generator
